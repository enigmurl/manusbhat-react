                    and this is my website. 
                    Among other things, I'm a student studying at UC San Diego, a developer looking to improve society, and an explorer understanding the world around me.
                    You can learn more about all of that right here!

                    {/* Explanation of my major */}
                    <p>
                    Growing up in Silicon Valley, I have been exposed to an innovative and risk-taking spirit since I was a young boy. Throughout the same time period,
                    I took interest in problem solving subjects in school. Topics like Machine Learning, Robotics, and Graph Theory began to capture to my passion. 
                    Mixing all of these together, choosing Mathematics and Computer Science to be my major came as a natural decision.
                    I especially like the theoretical side of computer science due to its mysterious beauty, though I partake in practical projects as well.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    A strong education, like anything, requires diversity. Therefore, I plan to supplement my studies with a minor in Business.
                    I understand the value entrepreneurs have brought to our country. Moreover, I am a strong believer in the capitalist economic model. 
                    With my first minor, I hope to learn how busineses are run and how people can be managed to produce things of value.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    If you couldn't tell already, I'm heavily interested in STEM. As such, my second minor will be in Physics. In comparision to 
                    other science disciplines, physics has the advantage of being logical and predictable. Within this subject I don't really have one favorite subfield; 
                    astrophysics and quantum mechanics excite me equally.
                    </p>

                    <hr className="home-separator"/>
                    <p>
                    Of course, I have interests that live outside the classroom.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    I enjoy nature and the outdoors. In particular, my family and I go hiking on the weekends. We occasionally watch documentaries
                    like Planet Earth together. Finally, I also go swinging in nearby parks.
                    
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Although I've never seen a rocket launch in-person before, I did visit Kennedy Space Center when I was a child.
                    This culminated in my love for spaceflight and the cosmos. Seeing pictures of distant nebula and galaxies has always left me star struck.
                    In general, I try to stay up to date on the latest scientific developments that go on in the aerospace industry.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Not everything about me is serious, though! A good chunk of my day is spent on Twitter, YouTube, Discord and other internet mediums.
                    I also play video games like Brawl Stars.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    While my art skills are far from being those of a prodigy, I still dip my toes into digital art from time to time. Anything from
                    video editing to graphic design is on the table. One particularly unique form I am well wersed in is mathematical animation, which 
                    I learned from my favorite YouTuber 3Blue1Brown. For reference, here are some of my other favorites:
