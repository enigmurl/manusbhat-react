                {/* Explanation of my major */}
                <p>
                Math-CS. I especially like the theoretical side of computer science. I've used it. 

                <br/>

                Business. As a strong believer in capitalism. Taking inspiration from the likes of Jassy, Musk and Bezos, I also have further interests in how entrepreneurship has shaped
                shaped our country, and have further plans. 

                <br/>

                Physics. I am interested in STEM. In comparision to other science disciplines, physics has the advantage of being
                logical and more predictable.
